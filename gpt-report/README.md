# GPT Implementation Report

This is an interactive report showcasing the implementation of a complete GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model from scratch. The project breaks down the transformer architecture into four fundamental tasks, providing hands-on experience with each component.

## Project Overview

The project implements a complete GPT model through four progressive tasks:

1. **Task 1: BPE Tokenization** - Byte Pair Encoding for efficient text tokenization
2. **Task 2: N-gram Language Modeling** - Statistical language modeling with n-gram approaches  
3. **Task 3: Neural Bigram Model** - Neural network implementation for bigram language modeling
4. **Task 4: GPT Architecture** - Complete transformer implementation with attention mechanisms and text generation

## Features

- **Interactive Flow Diagrams** - Visual representation of each task's implementation
- **Code Snippets** - Real implementation code from the actual Python files
- **Results Analysis** - Performance metrics and evaluation results
- **Architecture Details** - Comprehensive breakdown of transformer components

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
